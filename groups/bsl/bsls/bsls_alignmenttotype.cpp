///IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
///--------------------
// The core of the implementation logic to compute the most primitive type
// corresponding to a given 'ALIGNMENT' value is provided by the
// 'bsls_alignmentimp' component.  Ideally, we would like to create a simple
// template class that is specialized for each alignment value and that
// provides the corresponding fundamental type.  But since multiple types can
// have the same alignment, we need a mechanism to disambiguate between them.
// So we assign a priority value to each type matching a specified alignment.
// This priority value is computed by the 'bsls::AlignmentImpMatch::match'
// function, which is specialized on a given type's alignment and size.  Once
// the priority is calculated we use the 'bsls::AlignmentImpPriorityToType'
// meta-function to define the most primitive type for a specified 'ALIGNMENT'
// value.
