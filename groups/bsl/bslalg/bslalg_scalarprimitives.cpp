#ifndef BDE_OMIT_INTERNAL_DEPRECATED
// IMPLEMENTATION NOTES: The 'bslmf::IsPair' trait is slated to
// disappear, as a pair is like any other type w.r.t. the constructors and
// 'bslma::Allocator'.  Nevertheless, it is used for different purposes in
// libraries that depend on 'bslalg'.  For instance, 'bdepu' uses it for
// printing (a pair does not have a printing method, but it is possible to use
// the trait to forward the call to 'print' to its two members if they both
// have the printable trait).  More importantly, it is used in 'mgustd_pair' to
// forward allocators if needed (this relies on an older version of 'std::pair'
// which did not support allocators).  'mgustd_Pair' should be redesigned, but
// for now we have to support it or else risk breaking the Robo build.  For
// these reasons, we have retained the trait and support it in the
// implementations of 'bslalg::ScalarPrimitives::construct' and
// 'copyConstruct'.
