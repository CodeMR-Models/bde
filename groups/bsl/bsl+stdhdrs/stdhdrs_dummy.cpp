//@PURPOSE: Workaround for build tool.
//
//@AUTHOR: Arthur Chiu (achiu21)
//
//@DESCRIPTION: This is a workaround for the build tool since the tool requires
// at least one implementation file in a package.

// This symbol exists to avoid 'getarsym' errors when linking tests against the
// 'bsl+stdhdrs' package library on SunOS with gcc.
