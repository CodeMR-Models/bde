//@PURPOSE: Provide final declarations for each C++ standard header file.
//
//@SEE_ALSO: bsl_stdhdrs_prologue, bsl_stdhdrs_epilogue_recursive
//
//@AUTHOR: Pablo Halpern (phalpern), Arthur Chiu (achiu21)
//
//@DESCRIPTION: This epilogue file is intended to be included at the end of
// each bsl-supplied C++ standard library header file in "BDE-STL" mode.  This
// header '#include's bsl versions of some standard components, overriding
// those symbols included from the native standard library.  This epilogue also
// defines 'std' as a macro that expands to 'bsl', which contains a blend of
// symbols from the native standard library and Bloomberg defined container
// types.  The inclusion of this file at the end of a 'bsl+stdhdrs' header must
// be paired with the inclusion of 'bsl_stdhdrs_prologue.h' at the start of the
// same header.
//
// Note that there are no include guards.  THIS FILE IS INTENDED FOR MULTIPLE
// INCLUSION.

// Include corresponding 'bslstp' and 'bslstl' headers for each native STL
// header.  'bsl_stdhdrs_epilogue_recursive.h' is the implementation of the
// epilogue that gets included recursively until all native STL headers are
// matched with their corresponding 'bslstp' and 'bslstl' headers.
