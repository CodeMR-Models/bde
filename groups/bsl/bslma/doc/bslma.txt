@PURPOSE: Provide allocators, guards, and other memory-management tools.

@MNEMONIC: Basic Standard Library Memory Allocators (bslma)

@AUTHOR: Tom Marshall (tmarshal), Herve Bronnimann (hbronnim)

@DESCRIPTION: The 'bslma' package provides an allocator protocol (i.e., a pure
 abstract interface) and a variety of concrete allocators derived from this
 protocol, as well as other memory-dispensing mechanisms and various guard
 constructs to prevent loss in case of exceptions.  In addition, 'bslma' also
 provides a mechanism for installing a "default allocator" that will then be
 visible to all BDE and BDE-compliant code throughout that process.  If this
 mechanism is not invoked explicitly, then an allocator that uses global 'new'
 and 'delete' is the BDE default allocator.  This topic is discussed in more
 detail below.

/Component Overview
/------------------
 This section summarizes the components that are available in 'bslma'.
 Subsequent sections provide more detail on component selection, performance,
 and usage.

/'bslma_allocator'
/- - - - - - - - -
 'bslma_allocator' defines a protocol (i.e., an abstract base class) requiring
 the following interface: 'allocate' for memory allocation, and 'deallocate',
 for deallocation of individual allocated memory blocks.

/'bslma_autodeallocator'
/- - - - - - - - - - - -
 'bslma_autodeallocator' provides a "scoped guard" mechanism that assumes
 ownership responsibility for a block of memory obtained from an allocator
 having a 'deallocate' method; the memory is deallocated when the scoped guard
 goes out of scope, unless the memory is explicitly released.  This proctor
 mechanism is useful in guarding against memory leaks, e.g., when additional
 allocations may throw an exception.

/'bslma_autodestructor'
/ - - - - - - - - - - -
 'bslma_autodestructor' provides a "scoped guard" mechanism that assumes
 ownership of a sequence of objects that reside on contiguous memory that is
 *not* managed by the guard.  The objects are destroyed when the guard goes out
 of scope unless the proctored objects are explicitly released from management.
 Instance methods allow for adding objects to and removing objects from the
 sequence of managed objects.  This proctor mechanism is useful in guarding
 against memory leaks, e.g., when additional allocations may throw an
 exception.

/'bslma_autorawdeleter'
/ - - - - - - - - - - -
 'bslma_autorawdeleter' provides a range proctor class template to manage a
 sequence of (otherwise-unmanaged) objects of parameterized 'TYPE' supplied at
 construction.  If not explicitly released, the sequence of managed objects are
 deleted automatically when the range proctor goes out of scope by iterating
 over each object, first calling the (managed) object's destructor, and then
 freeing its memory footprint by invoking the 'deallocate' method of an
 allocator (or pool) of parameterized 'ALLOCATOR' type also supplied at
 construction.

/'bslma_deallocatorguard'
/ - - - - - - - - - - - -
 'bslma_deallocatorguard' provides a guard class template to unconditionally
 manage a block of (otherwise-unmanaged) memory.  The managed memory is
 deallocated automatically when the guard object goes out of scope using the
 'deallocate' method of the parameterized 'ALLOCATOR' (allocator or pool)
 supplied at construction.

/'bslma_deallocatorproctor'
/ - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 'bslma_deallocatorproctor' provides a proctor class template to conditionally
 manage a block of (otherwise-unmanaged) memory.  If not explicitly released,
 the managed memory is deallocated automatically when the proctor object goes
 out of scope by freeing the memory using the parameterized 'ALLOCATOR'
 (allocator or pool) supplied at construction.

/'bslma_default'
/- - - - - - - -
 'bslma_default' provides a namespace in which to declare a default allocator
 that can be used by any component requiring an allocator in cases where the
 client does not supply one, and two functions relating to this default
 allocator: a "setter", and a "getter".

/'bslma_defaultallocatorguard'
/- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 'bslma_defaultallocatorguard' provides a mechanism to enable safe, temporary
 replacement of the default allocator.

/'bslma_deleterhelper'
/- - - - - - - - - - -
 'bslma_deleterhelper' provides non-primitive procedures used to delete objects
 of parameterized 'TYPE' by first calling the destructor of the object, and
 then freeing the memory footprint of the object using a parameterized
 'ALLOCATOR' (allocator or pool) provided as a second argument.

/'bslma_destructorguard'
/- - - - - - - - - - - -
 'bslma_destructorguard' provides a guard class template to unconditionally
 manage an (otherwise-unmanaged) object of parameterized 'TYPE' supplied at
 construction.  The managed object is destroyed automatically when the guard
 object goes out of scope by calling the (managed) object's destructor.

/'bslma_destructorproctor'
/- - - - - - - - - - - - -
 'bslma_destructorproctor' provides a proctor class template to conditionally
 manage an (otherwise-unmanaged) object of parameterized 'TYPE' supplied at
 construction.  If not explicitly released, the managed object is destroyed
 automatically when the proctor object goes out of scope by calling the
 object's destructor.

/'bslma_mallocfreeallocator'
/- - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 'bslma_mallocfreeallocator' provides a wrapper around 'std::malloc' and
 'std::free' that adheres to the 'bslma::Allocator' protocol (i.e., provides
 'allocate' and 'deallocate' functions).

/'bslma_managedallocator'
/ - - - - - - - - - - - -
 'bslma_managedallocator' defines a protocol that extends the
 'bslma::Allocator' protocol with a 'release' function.  'release' indicates
 that all memory allocated since the previous 'release' call is to be
 deallocated.

/'bslma_newdeleteallocator'
/ - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 'bslma_newdeleteallocator' provides a wrapper around 'operator new' and
 'operator delete' that adheres to the 'bslma::Allocator' protocol (i.e.,
 provides an 'allocate' function and a 'deallocate' function).

/'bslma_rawdeleterguard'
/- - - - - - - - - - - -
 'bslma_rawdeleterguard' provides a guard class template to unconditionally
 manage an (otherwise-unmanaged) object of parameterized 'TYPE' supplied at
 construction.  The managed object is deleted automatically when the guard
 object goes out of scope by first calling the (managed) object's destructor,
 and then freeing the memory using the parameterized 'ALLOCATOR' (allocator or
 pool) also supplied at construction.

/'bslma_rawdeleterproctor'
/- - - - - - - - - - - - -
 'bslma_rawdeleterproctor' provides a proctor class template to conditionally
 manage an (otherwise-unmanaged) object of parameterized 'TYPE' supplied at
 construction.  If not explicitly released, the managed object is deleted
 automatically when the proctor object goes out of scope by first calling the
 (managed) object's destructor, and then freeing the memory using the
 parameterized 'ALLOCATOR' (allocator or pool) also supplied at construction.

/'bslma_testallocator'
/- - - - - - - - - - -
 'bslma_testallocator' provides an instrumented memory allocator drawing on
 'malloc'-provided memory, that can be exceedingly useful during development.

/'bslma_testallocatorexception'
/ - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 'bslma_testallocatorexception' defines an exception object for use in testing
 exceptions during memory allocations.

/'bslma_testallocatormonitor'
/ - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 'bslma_testallocatormonitor' provides a "monitor", a mechanism class, that
 allows concise tests of state change (or lack of change) in the test allocator
 provided at the monitor's construction.

/Allocators and Other Memory-Dispensing Mechanisms
/-------------------------------------------------
 An allocator is a memory manager that derives from the 'bslma::Allocator'
 protocol and provides an 'allocate' method for obtaining memory, and a
 'deallocate' method for returning memory (to the allocator).  'bslma' also
 provides many memory-dispensing mechanisms that also provide an 'allocate' and
 a 'deallocate' method, but these memory managers are not properly referred to
 as "allocators", since we reserve the term "allocator" for concrete memory
 dispensers that actually derive from 'bslma::Allocator' and are therefore
 usable anywhere that a 'bslma::Allocator *' is specified.  Objects that
 dispense memory but that are not actually "allocators" are sometimes called
 "end-point allocators", and may offer performance advantages to certain users.
 Choosing an allocation mechanisms is complex, and many factors will influence
 the decision.  The discussions here are aimed at shedding light on this
 important selection process.

 Characteristics differentiating among 'bslma' memory-allocation objects *in*
 *general* are:

: o Whether or not the object is a 'bslma::Allocator'.
:
: o Whether or not the allocator supports memory reuse.
:
: o Whether allocation requests consume the exact amount of memory requested,
:   an additive number of additional bytes, or a non-additive number of
:   additional bytes (e.g., the smallest power of two that can satisfy the
:   request).
:
: o Whether allocation requests consume the exact amount of memory requested,
:
: o Whether or not the allocator supports multi-threading.

 All 'bslma' allocators are thread-safe but not thread-enabled (see the 'bcema'
 package-level documentation for information on thread-enabled allocators).  In
 BDE terminology, a class is thread-safe if distinct threads can safely access
 *different* *instances* of that class simultaneously; a class is
 thread-enabled if distinct threads can safely access *the* *same* *instance*
 of that class simultaneously.

 The *BDE* allocators have two more differentiating properties.  First, whether
 the allocator is intended to be part of a chain (or other grouping) of
 allocators, or is an "end-point" allocator.  The former kind support the
 'bslma::Allocator' protocol.  "End-point" allocators, such as
 'bslma::SequentialPool', are designed for minimizing the runtime overhead of
 allocation and deallocation on a call-by-call basis.  This essentially
 corresponds to inlining the 'allocate' and 'deallocate' methods.

 Supporting a common protocol (the 'bslma::Allocator' protocol) allows passing
 conformant allocators to BDE (and other) objects requiring an allocator at
 construction.  Support of this common protocol also facilitates grouping the
 memory used by an object into one allocator.

 The second differentiating property is whether the allocator is a "managed" or
 "unmanaged" allocator.  Unmanaged allocators require every allocation to be
 matched by a deallocation, similar to 'malloc' and 'free', or 'new' and
 'delete'.  They also allow for simultaneous deallocation of all memory with
 one call to 'release'.  This 'release' optimization can provide significant
 performance improvements if the only system resource held by an object (and
 all the objects it manages) is memory.

 The BDE libraries use allocators with all classes requiring dynamic memory
 allocation, allowing clients to fine-tune memory-related performance
 characteristics by replacing the established defaults with client-chosen
 alternatives.  Because the protocol is public, clients can even write their
 own, customized implementations, and use those.  But none of these actions are
 required.  BDE components all work with a (preset) default allocator, and
 clients without special requirements need never concern themselves with
 allocators.

 Some other concerns regarding memory allocation are described next.  The
 discussion here broadens beyond allocators (strictly speaking, subtypes of
 'bslma::Allocator') to include both allocators and the other memory managers,
 i.e., the memory pools.

/Alignment
/---------
 Alignment of an *address* in memory refers to the relative position of that
 address with respect to specific (hardware-imposed) boundaries within the
 memory space.  Any one address can be said to be on a one-byte boundary, a
 two-byte boundary, a four-byte boundary, or an eight-byte boundary.  (Clearly,
 this sequence can be extended, but, as of this writing, boundaries beyond
 eight-byte boundaries are not relevant for these discussions on any hardware
 platform of interest.  In particular, "alignment" as we are using the term
 here does not deal with page boundaries or other larger memory structures,
 although these considerations are important elsewhere.)

 In general, we also speak about the alignment of (the *first* *byte* of) an
 entity (e.g., an 'int', a 'double', or a pointer) whose size is not
 necessarily one byte.  As a practical matter, for each entity separately, some
 alignments are "safe" and some are not.  By "not safe" we mean that, for most
 platforms (e.g., all of our Unix machines), attempting to access an entity at
 an address that is not safely aligned for that entity will cause a bus error,
 crashing the program on the spot.  In the very best case, the access will
 incur a performance penalty as the memory is shifted appropriately between its
 initial address and its target address (e.g., a register).

 The BDE memory managers provide three kinds of alignment: NATURAL, MAXIMAL,
 and BYTE -- but note that BYTE alignment is also referred to as "no alignment"
 or "none" in this document, since every address is aligned to *some* byte.

 A C/C++ variable is "naturally aligned" if its size divides the numerical
 value of its address.  An address is "maximally aligned" if it can serve as a
 naturally-aligned address no matter what type of object might be stored there.
 That is, it meets the alignment requirements of the type with the maximally
 restrictive needs.

 For example, on a platform where 'int' is 4 bytes, a variable such as
..
     int index;
..
 is naturally aligned if the compiler assigns it an address such as
..
     0x00A3920
..
 because 4 divides 66984 (the decimal equivalent of A3920).  The variable would
 not be naturally aligned were the compiler to place it at
..
     0x00A3921
..
 because 4 does not divide 66985.  An address whose numerical value is
 divisible by 8 is generally naturally aligned for any possible type, and so
 meets the definition of MAXIMUM alignment.

 Accessing data stored at an aligned address is *faster* on Intel platforms and
 *required* on almost all Unix platforms.  Reading (or writing) a C/C++
 variable at an unaligned address will cause a Bus Error on these Unix
 platforms, and thus crash the program.

 Normally, programmers need not worry about alignment for dynamically allocated
 memory.  The runtime system's 'new' (or 'malloc', for C) automatically return
 memory blocks beginning at maximally-aligned addresses (the C++ standard
 requires it of 'new').  The 'bslma::NewDeleteAllocator' does the same.
 Certain 'bslma' allocators and pools, however, return arbitrary addresses.  IT
 IS THEREFORE UNSAFE TO USE THOSE ALLOCATORS for storing 'int's, 'double's,
 'struct's, and other non-'char' types.

 A number of the 'bslma' memory managers *do* align.  They do so by:

: 1 Inferring the needed alignment from the size of the request, and returning
:   a NATURALLY aligned address for it, or
:
: 2 Returning a chunk of memory aligned to an address that would serve as a
:   properly-aligned address for a type with the largest possible alignment
:   needs, i.e., returning a MAXIMALLY aligned address.

 The cost of obtaining aligned addresses is twofold: an increase in the memory
 used (allocators returning aligned addresses do so by skipping bytes that
 could otherwise be used, so as to return an appropriate address), and
 additional computation time to calculate the needed alignment and subsequent
 offset.

/Deallocation
/------------
 Some of the managers do not deallocate individual items.  (The 'deallocate'
 function is almost always provided, but in these managers it performs no
 action.)  Such managers provide a 'release' function instead, which
 relinquishes *all* memory allocated by that manager since the previous
 'release' call.

/Type and Origination
/--------------------
 Most managers provide variable-sized, untyped (i.e., 'void *') memory.

 The different components manage memory in different ways, but they necessarily
 *obtain* the memory that they manage from one of the two usual sources: the
 heap or the stack.  The 'bslma::NewDeleteAllocator' is hard-coded to obtain
 memory from the heap -- its underlying source is 'operator new'.  The
 'bslma::BufferAllocator' is the best-suited manager for working with stack
 memory -- its source is a client-supplied array, a 'char *' plus length
 indicator.  All the other memory managers must be passed a 'bslma::Allocator'-
 derived type in their constructor, which they then use as the source of the
 memory they will manage.

 The managers are compared in the following tables:

 * Pooling potentially speeds up allocation over the allocation done by some
 underlying source, by (sub)allocating (and reclaiming) memory more quickly
 than the underlying source itself does.

 + Calling 'allocate' directly through an item of this (derived) type *will*
 result in an inlined function.  But calling through a base-class pointer,
 e.g.,
..
  bslma::SequentialAllocator  sqa;
  bslma::Allocator           *allocPtr = &sqa;
  allocPtr->allocate();
..
 will incur the overhead of a virtual function call.

/The Default Allocator
/---------------------
 All object types in BDE libraries needing dynamic memory require that an
 allocator be passed to their constructor.  They take a 'bslma::Allocator *'
 argument, which defaults to the value of 'bslma::Default::defaultAllocator()'.
 This value is set by BDE library code to be
 'bslma::NewDeleteAllocator::singleton()', but it can be changed:
 'bslma::Default::setDefaultAllocator' sets the value of the (global) default
 allocator, and 'bslma::Default::allocator' returns it.

/Interaction With Other Packages
/-------------------------------
 All BDE library objects needing dynamic memory require that an allocator be
 passed to their constructor, which defaults to the allocator currently
 installed as the default allocator.

/Usage
/-----
 This section illustrates intended use of this component.

/Example 1: 'bslma_SequentialAllocator' for a Database Driver
/ - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 ODBC/JDBC drivers are libraries providing standardized, language-appropriate
 API's for accessing SQL databases.  The standardization allows programmers
 using these drivers to access any vendor's SQL-based DBMS in the same way.
 Language-appropriate means that the provided API's conform better to how
 programmers typically work with data in C/C++ (or Java, respectively); they
 provide functions for reading the data as language-specific types, e.g.,
 'getInt', 'getString', and so on.

 Suppose we wanted to write an ODBC/JDBC-like driver for legacy files, so that
 application could access these data files with the same API used for accessing
 DBMS-stored data.  Which memory manager would be best?

 ODBC drivers return C++ types, and initially this indicates use of a memory
 manager that will provide properly-aligned addresses for storing those types.
 This example will in fact use such a manager, illustrating alignment
 considerations.

 But note that an alternative design would store the returned data in the
 character-sequence form in which they are stored in the file, and convert them
 to type-correct values *only* when the client *asks* for a particular item.
 This kind of lazy evaluation would be more effective in scenarios where
 clients read fields at most once (i.e., sometimes not at all).  In such a
 design, a non-aligning manager would do.

 We cannot know in advance how long a client will want to hold onto a result
 set (the data returned from a SQL query).  But because we are implementing in
 C++, the language provides a construct whose semantics correspond directly to
 the notion of "no longer needing an object" -- i.e., a destructor.  If we make
 our result set a class, invocation of the destructor will serve as our
 indication that the client no longer needs the result set contents.  We use
 this knowledge in our design by giving each result set object a unique memory
 allocator (a 'bslma::SequentialAllocator') and have the destructor of the
 result object release in a single operation all memory acquired for each
 result in the result set.

 (Most ODBC/JDBC drivers provide separate classes representing a database
 connection, an SQL statement, a query result set, and so on.  We simplify the
 example by defining one class, 'MyResultSet', that executes the query as well
 as returning the results; query execution in a real driver would typically
 belong to a 'Statement' class.

 Note that the use of allocators in this example is similar to the use in the
 previous example -- allocation when needed, and the performance-enhancing
 simultaneous 'release' when deallocating.  The intent in providing this
 example is not to show a different pattern, but to motivate use of aligning
 allocators, as distinct from the unaligned one in Usage Example 1.)

 As before, we highlight use of the allocator by commenting its use with
 asterisks.

  };
..
 We simplify this example by only implementing data retrieval for three types.
 (A real driver, of course, would define an API for each supported type.)  Note
 also that the function signature style conforms to BDE design -- rather than
 returning the data as the *return* *result* of the function call, we return it
 by placing it into the variable whose address we are passed as the first
 function argument, the *output* parameter.  We reserve the return value for
 indicating error status.

 We further simplify the example by *simulating* query execution, so that the
 example code can be extracted from this file and executed.  The simulation
 involves including a (const) sequence of 'char's representing a data block as
 it would come back from the read file, a block which our code then parses.
 This simplification necessarily also involves hard-coding metadata that would
 also be obtained by computation, such as how many records were returned.

/Example 2: Sketch Use of 'bslma::BufferAllocator'
/- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 Clients can take advantage of the faster and cheaper memory originating on the
 stack for use with objects (wanting allocators) that are used as *local*
 *variables* within some procedure.
..
  class MyLargeObject {
      // ....
  };

  int myMain2()
  {
      {
          bsl::vector<MyLargeObject> someLocalVariable;
      }
..
 Vectors accept allocators, too, which (along with other BDE components) use
 the default allocator when none is explicitly supplied.  For most
 applications, the default is heap-originated memory (i.e., the
 'bslma::NewDeleteAllocator').

 We can often speed up such local use by grabbing sufficient stack space and
 passing it in to the local object, wrapped in a 'bslma::_BufferAllocator'.

 The code above might look like
..
      {
          int                        initSize = 10;
          char                       hugeLocalArray[5000];
          bslma::BufferAllocator     allocator(hugeLocalArray, // DEPRECATED!
                                               sizeof(hugeLocalArray));
          bsl::vector<MyLargeObject> someLocalVariable(initSize,
                                                       &allocator);
      }
..
 The safest use passes the 'bslma::BufferAllocator' a "fallback" to use, should
 the stack space we grabbed prove insufficient.  The fallback must be a
 (pointer to a) function that accepts an 'int' (the requested number of bytes)
 and returns a 'void *' (the presumed pointer to an allocated memory block).

 We write a simple fallback function as follows:
..
  struct Local {
      static void *ersatzNew(int numBytes)
      {
          return new char[numBytes];
      }
  };
..
 and then redo the above code to pass this fallback to our buffer allocator:
..
      {
         int                        initSize = 10;
         char                       hugeLocalArray[5000];
         bslma::BufferAllocator     allocator(hugeLocalArray,
                                              sizeof(hugeLocalArray),
                                              Local::ersatzNew);
         bsl::vector<MyLargeObject> someLocalVariable(initSize,
                                                      &allocator);
      }
  }
..
