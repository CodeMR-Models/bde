//
// IMPLEMENTATION NOTES: A deque is constructed as an array, 'd_blocks' of
// pointers to fixed-sized blocks of elements.  The array of pointers may have
// any number of unused elements at the beginning and/or end.  Elements can be
// inserted or removed from either end without moving any existing elements,
// simply by adding new blocks or removing empty ones.  A deque iterator
// contains a pointer 'd_value_p', to the referenced element and also a
// pointer, 'd_blockPtr_p', which points to the 'd_blocks' slot containing the
// pointer to the element's block (see diagram below).  The 'd_start' iterator
// points to the first used slot in 'd_blocks' and to the first used elements
// within the first block.  The 'd_finish' iterator points to the last used
// slot in 'd_blocks' and one past the last used element within the last block.
// 'd_blocksLength' holds the length of 'd_blocks', including unused slots.
//..
//   a-n : current elements in the deque
//   _   : uninitialized/destructed elements

///INVARIANTS
/// - - - - -
//..
// Class 'bslstl::DequeIterator' invariants for non-singular iterators:
//   - 'd_blockPtr_p' always points to a valid pointer to a valid block.
//   - 'd_value_p' always points within range '[blockBegin(), blockEnd())'
//   - Thus 'd_value_p' never points past the end of a block.
//
// Class 'bslstl_Deque' invariants:
//   - There is always at least one block allocated ('d_blocksLength' > 0).
//   - 'd_start' always points into the first allocated block.
//   - 'd_finish' always points into the last allocated block.
//   - The last block is never full.  Thus if 'size()' == 'BLOCK_LENGTH'
//     then there must be two blocks.
//   - 'd_finish' never points past the end of a block.
//   - The first block has zero or more uninitialized elements at the
//     beginning, the last block has one or more uninitialized elements at
//     the end.  All other blocks are full.
//   - The 'd_blocks' array may contain unused pointers at the beginning
//     and/or end.  The closed range,
//     '[d_start.d_blockPtr_p, d_finish.d_blockPtr_p]', is the range of
//     valid pointers within the 'd_blocks' array.
//
// For deques constructed with the 'RAW_INIT' argument ("raw" deques), the
// above invariants do not apply.  The following invariants do apply:
//   - A raw deque has singular values for 'd_start' and 'd_finish'.  (A
//     singular 'IteratorImp' value is one where both members are nil.)
//   - A raw deque has in constructed with 'd_blocks == 0' and
//     'd_blocksLength == 0'.
//   - 'd_blocks' and 'd_blocksLength' may be set to valid values, but no
//     blocks are allocated.
//   - Once one or more blocks are allocated and 'd_start' and 'd_finish'
//     set to point into those blocks, the deque is no longer raw and must
//     adhere to the normal deque invariants, above.
//   - Raw deques can be destructed and can be used with certain internal
//     operations, but must never be visible to the user.
