@PURPOSE: Provide compatibility for clients using single-level namespace

@DEPRECATED:  Do not use.

@MNEMONIC: Basic Standard Library System forwarding declarations (bslfwd)

@AUTHOR: Steven Breitstein (sbreitstein)

@DESCRIPTION: Each component of this package provides a code snippet defining a
 forward reference to a corresponding type within 'bsl' (e.g.,
 'bslfwd_bslma_allocator' defines a forward reference to the type defined in
 'bslma_allocator').  If 'BSLFWD_BUILDTARGET_BSL_USING_NAMESPACES' is defined,
 the forward declaration will refer the 'bsl' type in the two-level namespace;
 otherwise, it will refer to the type in the legacy single-level namespace
 (e.g., 'bslma::Allocator' versus 'bslma_Allocator', both in the 'BloombergLP'
 namespace).

 The components in this package are provided to provide backward compatibility
 for existing clients.  All new code must be written using the two-level
 namespace for 'bsl' types.
