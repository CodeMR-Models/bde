 bslscm.txt

@PURPOSE: Provide versioning information for BDE library components.

@AUTHOR: Tom Marshall (tmarshal)

@SEE ALSO: bdescm

@DESCRIPTION: This package provides versioning information that is incorporated
 into every release of the 'bsl' Package Group Library.  This versioning
 information is in turn available to all clients of 'bsl' both at run-time and
 by inspection of appropriate '.o' files.  See '{BP BDE_SCM<GO>}' for a
 detailed specification of the BDE source control contract.  Note that, except
 for the package name, this version functionality is repeated in every package
 group within the BDE library suite.
