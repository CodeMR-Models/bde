@PURPOSE: Provide replacement classes (adopted from STLport) for STL.

@MNEMONIC: Basic Standard Library STlPort types (bslstp)

@AUTHOR: Arthur Chiu (achiu21)

@DESCRIPTION: This package mainly provides replacement classes, adopted from
 STLport, for STL constructs that required modification to (inter)operate with
 BDE libraries.  In addition to STL replacement classes, this package also
 provides helper components for the STL implementation classes.

 In general, the components in this package conform to the STL interface.
 However, the components (and hence the headers) are intended for private use
 only.  Clients should use the standard headers directly (e.g., include
 '<bsl_map.h>' instead of '<bslstp_map.h>').

/Hierarchical Synopsis
/---------------------
 'bslstp' currently has 15 components having 3 levels of physical dependency.
 The table below shows the hierarchical ordering of the components.  The
 package prefix and underscore ('bslstp_') are omitted from the full component
 names for layout efficiency.
..
  Level 3:  map                set                 hashmap
            hashset

  Level 2:  tree               hashtable           list
            slist              sstream

  Level 1:  queue              stack               slistbase
            alloc              iterator            iosfwd
..

/Component Synopsis
/------------------
 The following is a brief synopsis of the components in 'bslstp'.  For the sake
 of brevity, we sometimes blur the distinction between a component and the
 primary types that the component provides.  We remind the reader that, in
 general, the distinction between a component and a class is important.
..
  'bslstp_alloc'      - allocator-related traits and container base adapter

  'bslstp_hashmap'    - SGI extension of a hash table and multi-hash table

  'bslstp_hashset'    - SGI extension of a hash set and multi-hash set

  'bslstp_hashtable'  - generic hash table used to implement 'hashmap' and
                        'hashset'

  'bslstp_iosfwd'     - forward declaration of stream classes that use
                        'bsl::allocator'

  'bslstp_iterator'   - iterator-related traits

  'bslstp_list'       - conforming 'std::list' implementation

  'bslstp_map'        - conforming 'std::map' and 'std::multimap'
                        implementations

  'bslstp_queue'      - conforming 'std::queue' implementation

  'bslstp_set'        - conforming 'std::set' and 'std::multiset'
                        implementations

  'bslstp_slist'      - SGI extension of a singly-linked list

  'bslstp_slistbase'  - helper class for implementation of 'slist'

  'bslstp_sstream'    - conforming 'std::sstream' implementation

  'bslstp_stack'      - conforming 'std::stack' implementation

  'bslstp_tree'       - generic red black tree used to implement 'map' and
                        'set'
