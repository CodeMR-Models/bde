@MNEMONIC: Basic Application Environment (bae)

@AUTHOR: Tom Marshall (tmarshal)

@DESCRIPTION: The 'bae' ("Basic Applications Environment") package group
 contains at present one package (beyond the required 'baescm' source
 management versioning package -- see 'bdescm' for a general discussion of
 version control).  That package, 'bael', provides a logging toolkit suitable
 for deployment in all production environments.

/Hierarchical Synopsis
/---------------------
 'bae' depends upon the 'bce' and 'bde' package groups:
..
    Level 3:   bae

    Level 2:   bce

    Level 1:   bde
..
 'bae' currently has has 2 packages forming 2 levels physical of dependency.
 Note the required source control package 'baescm'.  The table below shows the
 physical dependency hierarchy among the packages.
..
   Level  2: bael

   Level  1: baescm
..

/Package Synopsis
/----------------
 The following is a brief synopsis of the content of each package in 'bae'.
..
    1. 'bael'   - Logging toolkit with standard and special-purpose (e.g.,
                  "trace-back") features
    2. 'baescm' - Introspective versioning information for each 'bae' release
..

/Package Overview
/----------------
 The following provides a brief overview of the 'bae' packages.  See the
 respective Package Level documents for more details and usage examples.

/bael
/- -
 'bael' provides a logging toolkit that, in turn, provides administerable,
 customizable logging facilities for libraries and applications.  The logging
 toolkit is thread-enabled, and thus suitable for multi-threaded applications.
 'bael' provides the capability to log to an in-memory buffer or directly to an
 "Observer" object that is itself user-customizable.  The logger understands
 the concepts of logging to a "category" at a "severity level".  Specific
 logger behavior (e.g., disabled logging or "publishing" the in-memory buffer)
 is governed by various "threshold levels" for a given message severity level,
 for each category.  These thresholds may be administered dynamically, i.e.,
 while the process is running.

/baescm
/- - -
 'baescm' is a special source control management package containing a single
 component, 'baescm_version'.  This component is included by every other
 component in 'bae', and provides versioning information for the package group.
 Users may use the 'baescm_version' facilities to query a particular 'bae'
 library for its version information.  See {BP BDE_SCM <GO>} for a detailed
 specification for the archetype 'bdescm' package.
