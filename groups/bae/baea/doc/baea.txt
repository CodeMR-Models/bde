@DESCRIPTION: The 'baea' package provides support for an assortment of common
 application-level services (e.g., command-line processing).  In particular,
 'baea' includes the following:
 : o Classes for parsing, validating, and accessing the command-line arguments
 :   of a program.
 : o A mechanism for monitoring and reporting the observable performance of a
 :   process.
 : o Classes for (1) defining commands (as short strings), (2) passing these
 :   commands through a pipe-channel to a running process, and (3) registering
 :   callback functions to be invoked upon reception of such commands.
 : o A metric reporting protocol and a value-semantic type to represent
 :   metrics.  Note that the metric reporting facilities provided by 'baea'
 :   have been !DEPRECATED! in lieu of 'baem'.
