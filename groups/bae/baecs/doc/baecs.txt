@PURPOSE: Provide special-purpose application-level containers.

@AUTHOR: Rohan Bhindwale (rbhindwa)

@DESCRIPTION: The 'baecs' package contains a small number of special-purpose
 application-level containers.  Of particular note are the 'baecs_journal' and
 'baecs_mappingmanager' components that provide a file-backed persistent
 journal, and an in-process manager of mmap pages, respectively.  Note that the
 'baecs_journalheader' and 'baecs_journalpageheader' components are intended
 for use internally by 'baecs_journal', and should not be used directly by
 client code.

/Component Synopsis
/------------------
 The following is a brief synopsis of the components in 'baecs'.  For the sake
 of brevity, we sometimes blur the distinction between a component and the
 primary types that the component provides.  We remind the reader that, in
 general, the distinction between a component and a class is important.
