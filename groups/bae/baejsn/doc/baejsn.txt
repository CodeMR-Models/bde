@PURPOSE: Provide components for encoding/decoding in the JSON format.

@MNEMONIC: Basic Application Environment JSoN (baejsn)

@AUTHOR: Rohan Bhindwale (rbhindwa)

@DESCRIPTION: The 'baejsn' package provides facilities for encoding and
decoding value-semantic objects in the JSON encoding format.  Currently, the
encoder and decoder provided in this package work with types that support the
'bdeat' framework (see the 'bdeat' package for details), which is a
compile-time interface for manipulating struct-like and union-like objects.
In particular, types generated by the 'bas_codegen.pl' tool, and dynamic types
such as 'bcem_Aggregate' can be used.

/Hierarchical Synopsis
/---------------------
 The 'baejsn' package has 7 components having three levels of dependency.  The
 table below shows the hierarchical ordering of the components.  The package
 prefix and underscore ('baejsn_') are omitted from the full component names
 for layout efficiency.  The ordering within each level is simply alphabetical
 and has no architectural significance.

  Level 3: decoder           encoder

  Level 2: tokenizer

  Level 1: decoderoptions    encoderoptions    parserutil    printutil
..
