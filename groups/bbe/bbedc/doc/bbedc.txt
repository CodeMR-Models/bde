@MNEMONIC: Basic Business Environment Day-Count (bbedc)

@DESCRIPTION: The 'bbedc' package consists of utilities for calculating common
 day-count conventions.  In fixed income, interest payments occur at regular
 intervals.  Various day-count conventions have been developed over the years
 for simplifying the calculation of these interest-accrual periods.  For
 example, simplifications include assuming (1) that all months have 30 days,
 and/or (2) that all years have 360 or 365 days.  Complications arise when
 these simplified day-counts eventually must be synchronized with actual months
 (having anywhere from 28 to 31 days) and years (having either 365 or 366
 days).  'bbedc' supports many of the standard day-count conventions, with each
 in its own component.
