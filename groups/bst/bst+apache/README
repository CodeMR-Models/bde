This directory contains a suite of tests that come with the Apache
implementation of the C++ standard library (originally developed by
Rogue Wave).  The directory structure has been modified to match the
requirements of a Bloomberg non-conforming package.  To get the Apache
STL and unpack it into this directory structure,

1. Get the apache STL tar file from
   http://stdcxx.apache.org/download.html AND
2. Unpack it into this directory using ./unpack.pl stdcxx-*.tar.gz

The unmodified sources from this test suite are in the
/main/bb/unmodified-apache-stl branch in clearcase.  Updates from the apache
site should be checked into the unmodified-apache-stl branch, then merged into
the dev branch.

The rw directory contains stubs for facilities used by the tests but not
available in a normal STL.

The tests were modified to turn off eliminate tests for Rogue Wave (RW)
extensions and for bugs that we are not yet fixing.  The tests for RW
extensions are turned off by preprocessor conditional directives querying
TEST_RW_EXTENSIONS.  Tests that expose bugs in our implementation are
turned off by preprocessor conditional directives querying macros that
contain the word "DRQS".  Changes that work around bugs in the RW code
are controlled by preprocessor conditional directives querying the macro
RW_BUG.
