 bdl+decnumber.txt

@PURPOSE: Provide third-party decimal floating point library (IBM decNumber).

@SEE_ALSO: bdldfp_decimal

@DESCRIPTION: The 'bdl+decnumber' non-standard package contains the open-source
 decNumber library.  'bdl+decnumber' should *not* be used directly by client
 code.  It is intended to be used (internally) *only* by 'bdldfp_decimal' and
 'bdldfp_decimalutil'.  Note that the not all the decNumber source files are
 included, only those that we really need.  The 'bdl+decnumber' library wraps
 the decNumber library, at version 3.68, available under the ICU license.
 Example files and pdf documentation were removed to conserve space.  The
 source is available from 'http://speleotrove.com/decimal/#decNumber'.
