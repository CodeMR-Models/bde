 bdl+decnumber.txt

@PURPOSE: Provide third-party decimal floating point library (IBM decNumber).

@SEE_ALSO: bdldfp_decimal

@DESCRIPTION: The 'bdl+decnumber non-standard package contains the open-source
 decNumber library.  'bdl+decnumber should *not* be used directly by client
 code.  It is intended to be used (internally) *only* by 'bdldfp_decimal' and
 'bdldfp_decimalutil'. Note that the not all the decNumber source files are
 included, only those that we really need.  The BDL+decNumber library wraps the
 decNumber library, at version 3.68, available under the ICU license.  Example
 files and pdf documentation were removed to conserve space.
