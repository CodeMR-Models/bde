The package has been dowloaded from http://speleotrove.com/decimal/#decNumber .
The latest version downloaded is 3.68 of the ICU licensed package.

o Download source code from http://speleotrove.com/decimal/#decNumber .  Be
  very certain that you download the ICU licensed distribution only!  Our use
  is not compatible with the GPL (the other available license).  The first
  release of bdl+decnumber is based on the 3.68 version.

o In general, I would not recommend bulk-updating our coee from the
  distribution; however since it may become necessary, I outline a possible
  process below

o Note that you cannot necessarily just overwrite files in our repository with
  newer files from the distribution, as some of these files have been updated
  to suit our needs:
    decNumberLocal.h
    decContext.h

o The base version is stored in the 'original' directory as a ZIP file with the
   version name in its filename 'decNumber-icu-3.68.zip' and you may use the
   sources from the archive to diff against.

o NOTE that the PDF documentation has been removed from the original archive,
  otherwise it would be too large )binary file) for comfort (in a version
  control system).  You may find the PDF documentation in the 'doc' directory.

o NOTE that if you need to download and archive a new version of the
  base-souces you *must* also remove any large binary file from that archive
  before putting it into git; and also make sure its file name has the proper
  version number included.

o You will need to check the differences between the base version (3.68 now)
  and your downloaded version for the updated files and figure out how to apply
  those changes to our version - and if we need further updates to the file(s).
  To aid this process I will describe (in this file) the nature of our
  update(s) our assumptions.

o You will also need to look at the differences between the new files and our
  files for those files that we have not edited - to make sure that we do not
  miss a breaking change, or a new dependency etc.

o Make sure you check the errata and apply any bugfixes listed there:
  http://speleotrove.com/decimal/decnumerr.html
  No errata changes have been applied to this version (3.68).  If you do apply
  such changes list them in this file.

o Pay special attention to possible new settings (MACROS) that need to be added
  or changed in decNumberLocal.h

o Note that due to the way our build system works the "included .c files" must
  go into the 'common' subdirectory (so our build system does not try to build
  tehm and fail).

o Apply the necessary changes to our git repository.

o Do *not* copy in files that are not used.

o Make sure everything still builds and runs on all supported platforms.

o Update this file to reflect the new state of the art.
