@MENMONIC: Basic Development Environment Meta-Functions (bdemf)

@AUTHOR Lea Fester (lfester)

@DESCRIPTION: The 'bdemf' package provides meta-function equivalents of 
 certain useful coding constructs.  A meta-function is a template-based,
 compile-time construct that behaves like a (runtime) function in that it
 "evaluates" arguments and does something different based on the input
 it is passed (in the case of templates, the input it is instantiated with).
 
 'bdemf' provides metafunctions to evaluate (at compile time) constructs such
 as the following: an if-statement equivalent, whether a (template) argument
 is a fundamental type, whether an argument is an 'enum' type, whether two
 arguments have the same type, and more.
