@AUTHOR: Lea Fester (lfester)

@DESCRIPTION: The 'bdec' package provides a variety of container classes that
 are either more specialized than those provided by STL, or else offer
 alternative performance characteristics.  Note that some of the containers
 in this package have been *DEPRECATED* in favor of the equivalent STL type.
 'bdec' container classes include:
..
  1. A days-of-the-week set class.

  2. Queue template classes.
