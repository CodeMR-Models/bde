@AUTHOR: Lea Fester (lfester)

@DESCRIPTION: The 'bdec' package provides a variety of container classes that
 are either more specialized than those provided by STL, or else offer
 alternative performance characteristics.  Note that many of the containers
 in this package have been *DEPRECATED* in favor of the equivalent STL type.

/Hierarchical Synopsis
/---------------------
 The 'bdec' package currently has 4 components having 2 levels of physical

 The order of components within each level is not architecturally significant,
 just alphabetical.
