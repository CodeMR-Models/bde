o Download source code from http://www.pcre.org.  The first release of bde+pcre
  was based on pcre-5.0.tar.gz.

o Copy the following to groups/bde/bde+pcre:
    get.c
    internal.h
    maketables.c
    pcre.c
    study.c

o Copy the following to groups/bde/bde+pcre:
    config.h
    pcre.h
  These files are generated by the following (identically on all platforms):
    $ configure --enable-utf8

o Copy the following to groups/bde/bde+pcre:
    chartables.c
  This file is generated by the following (identically on all platforms):
    $ make

o Copy the following to groups/bde/bde+pcre/test:
    pcretest.c
    printint.c
    testinput1
    testinput2
    testinput3
    testinput4
    testinput5
    testinput6
    ucp.h
    ucptypetable.c

o Tailor code as needed.  Local customizations made to the PCRE source code
  include the following:
  - Pass 'bdema_Allocator *allocator' where appropriate.
  - Enclose global symbols in 'namespace BloombergLP' and give them C++
    linkage.
  - Comment out all global variables.
  - Eliminate compiler warnings ("defined but not used", "set but not used",
    etc.).
  - Update .exp files (expected output of test drivers) to coincide with our
    configuration.
