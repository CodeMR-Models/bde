@DESCRIPTION: THIS PACKAGE IS *DEPRECATED*.  This package defines the common
 (partially implemented) base classes for all internal representations of the
 'bdef_Vfunc*' families of function objects (functors).  These abstract base
 classes declare the pure virtual 'execute' method, whose signature
 characterizes this family of functor representations, while exploiting
 structural inheritance to implement efficient (inline) count manipulators.
 The counter is intended to reflect the number of 'bdef_Vfunc*' objects
 (envelopes) or other partial owners that are currently using this functor
 representation (letter) and is manipulated by each owner accordingly.

 The counter used by these components is atomic, thereby providing thread-safe
 increment and decrement operations.  The classes also provides static
 'deleteObject' methods to allow clients to destroy the object (when the count
 reaches '0') without any information about the details of the 'bdefr_Vfunc*'
 object memory management scheme.  Note that the object must be allocated
 dynamically using the same allocator supplied at construction and that the
 allocator must remain valid through the life of the object.  The
 'deleteObject' method allows concrete classes derived from 'bdefr_Vfunc*' to
 declare their destructors 'private' and limit object instantiation to the
 heap.

 Each component in this package implements a single templatized functor base
 class; the number at the end of the class name indicates the number of
 arguments in the function's 'execute()' signature.

 Note that clients may load a given 'bdefr' functor with their own free or
 member function that requires more than the given number of arguments.  The
 additional arguments are bound to specific pre-defined values by an
 appropriate function in the 'bdefu' package.  See that package for additional
 information.

/USAGE
/-----
 Most clients will not use 'bdefr' or 'bdefi' classes directly; rather, they
 will create 'bdef' functors, and populate them with utility functions from the
 'bdefu' package.  See the package documentation for package 'bdef' for
 examples that illustrate this usage.

 In order to understand in detail how the 'bdefr' components and classes work,
 refer to the usage example in Component 'bdefr_vfunc2'.
