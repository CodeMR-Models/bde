@DESCRIPTION: The 'bdempu' package provides procedures that convert text
 representations to 'bdem' objects (parsing utilities) and that convert objects
 to equivalent text representations (generator utilities).

 The 'bdem' package contains the components which define the types parsed by
 procedures in this package.

 'bdempu' routines parse or generate the following types or entities:
..
    1.  The (type) words "CHAR", "SHORT", "INT", "INT64", "FLOAT", "DOUBLE",
        "STRING", "DATETIME", "DATE", "TIME", "CHAR_ARRAY", "SHORT_ARRAY",
        "INT_ARRAY", "INT64_ARRAY", "FLOAT_ARRAY", "DOUBLE_ARRAY",
        "STRING_ARRAY", "DATETIME_ARRAY", "DATE_ARRAY", "TIME_ARRAY", "LIST",
        and "TABLE".
    2.  'bdem_List's and 'bdem_Table's (i.e., the containers).
    3.  'bdem_Schema' (i.e., 'bdem' metadata).
    4.  Constrained lists, constrained tables, and scopes (i.e., data along
        with its constraining metadata).
..
 The (in-memory) 'bdem' objects are predominantly used for messaging.  Their
 *textual equivalents* are predominantly used for configuration files, such as
 the following:
..
  {
     Schedule = {
       [ Name  OpenPeriods ]

       { "US"  { [ OpenDays Period ]
                { 12345   { Start = 08:00:00.000 Finish = 16:15:00.000 }}}
       }
       { "BEAR_TEST" { [ OpenDays Period ]
                { 12345   { Start = 08:00:00.000 Finish = 16:15:00.000 }}
                { 6       { Start = 10:00:00.000 Finish = 14:00:00.000 }}}
       }
     }  // end Schedule
     Connections = {
       [ Name    Schedule      Description                   ClickAction ]
       { "BEAR1" "US"          "Government Bond Prices"      "AECI" }
       { "BEAR2" "BEAR_TEST"   "Mortgage Pool Prices"        "AECI" }
       { "GMSC1" "Schedule-US" "Government Bond Prices"      "PWHO" }
       { "GMSC2" "Schedule-US" "High-Grade Corp Bond Prices" "AECI" }
       { "GMSC3" "Schedule-US" "High-Yield Corp Bond Prices" "AECI" }
     }  // end Connections
  }
..
 It is useful to note that the parsing routines do not provide client control
 over handling internal whitespace; where no ambiguity is possible, they are
 always whitespace-neutral.
