@PURPOSE: Provide concrete 'streambuf' implementations.

@MNEMONIC: Basic Development Environment Stream Buffers (bdesb)

@AUTHOR Tom Marshall (tmarshal)

@SEE_ALSO: bdex

@DESCRIPTION: The 'bdesb' package provides concrete implementations of the
 'std::streambuf' interface.  In particular, these implementations use either a
 fixed-size user-supplied buffer or else manage a buffer obtained from a
 user-supplied or default allocator.  Also, concrete implementations are
 specialized to implement either the input ot the output portion of the
 interface.  

/Hierarchical Synopsis
/---------------------
 'bdesb' currently has three components having one level of dependency.
 The table below shows the hierarchical ordering of the components.  The
 package prefix and underscore ('bdesb_') are omitted from the full component
 names for layout efficiency.
..
  Level 1: memoutstreambuf  fixedmemoutstreambuf  fixedmeminstreambuf
..
 
/Component Synopsis
/------------------
 The following is a brief synopsis of the components in 'bdesb'.
..
  bdesb_fixedmeminstreambuf  - input streambuf using a client-supplied fixed
                               buffer
  bdesb_fixedmemoutstreambuf - output streambuf using a client-supplied fixed
                               buffer
  bdesb_memoutstreambuf      - output streambuf managing a dynamic buffer
..
 Each component implements a portion of the 'std::streambuf' interface, either
 for input or for output.
