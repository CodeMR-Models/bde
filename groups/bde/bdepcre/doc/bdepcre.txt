@PURPOSE: Provide a mechanism to process Perl-compatible regular expressions.

@MNEMONIC: Basic Development Environment PCRE (bdepcre)

@AUTHOR: Arthur Chiu (achiu21)

@DESCRIPTION: This package provides a BDE-style mechanism that wraps the
 open-source PCRE package ('bde+pcre').  Users can create regular expressions
 compatible with Perl 5.8, and then match the regular expression to strings.

/Component Synopsis
/------------------
 The following is a brief synopsis of the components in 'bdepcre'.  For the
 sake of brevity, we sometimes blur the distinction between a component and the
 primary types that the component provides.  We remind the reader that, in
 general, the distinction between a component and a class is important.
