@PURPOSE: Provide versioning information for BDE library components.

@MNEMONIC: Basic Development Environment Source Control Management (bdescm)

@AUTHOR Tom Marshall (tmarshal)

@DESCRIPTION: This package provides versioning information that is incorporated
 into every release of the 'bde' Package Group Library.  This versioning
 information is in turn available to all clients of 'bde' both at run time and
 by inspection of appropriate '.o' files.  See '{BP BDE_SCM<GO>}' for a
 detailed specification of the BDE source control contract.  Note that, except
 for the package name, this version functionality is repeated in every package
 group within the BDE library suite.  This document therefore serves as
 documentation for all 'XXXscm' packages within BDE.

/Hierarchical Synopsis
/---------------------
 The 'bdescm' package currently has 3 components having 2 levels of physical
 dependency.  The table below shows the hierarchical ordering of the
 components.  The order of components within each level is not architecturally
 significant, just alphabetical.
..
  2. bdescm_version

  1. bdescm_patchversion
     bdescm_versiontag
..

/Component Synopsis
/------------------
: 'bdescm_patchversion':
:      Provide common patch versioning information.
:
: 'bdescm_version':
:      Provide source control management (versioning) information.
:
: 'bdescm_versiontag':
:      Provide versioning information for the 'bde' package group.

/Usage
/-----
 The single component in 'bdescm' is 'bdescm_version', which provides the
 'struct' 'bdescm_Version'.  Every component in every package in 'bde' (except
 for components in 'bdes' -- for technical dependency reasons) must depend on
 'bdescm_version' (via an explicit '#include' directive).  This makes the
 static methods of 'bdescm_Version' available to all clients of 'bde'.

 The methods provided by 'bdescm_Version' are:
..
  struct bdescm_Version {
      static const char *d_ident;
      static const char *d_what;

      static const char *d_version;
      static const char *d_dependencies;
      static const char *d_buildInfo;
      static const char *d_timestamp;
      static const char *d_sourceControlInfo;

      static const char *version();
  };
..
 Again, see '{BP BDE_SCM<GO>}' for details.
