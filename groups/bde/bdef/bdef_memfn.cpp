///IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
///--------------------
// bdef_MemFn: The 'operator()' methods of the 'bdef_MemFn' wrapper need to
// be implemented within the class body for SUNPRO CC (even for version 5.5,
// a.k.a. Studio 8).  This is because that compiler accepts out-of-class-body
// definitions for template members, but not for template operators.
//
// bdef_MemFnInstance: There are two ways to handle instance wrappers around
// class types that take a 'bslma' allocator.  One is to store the wrapper in a
// constructor proxy.  The other is to simply disallow it (asserting that
// 'INSTANCE_WRAPPER' does not have the 'bslalg::TypeTraitUsesBslmaAllocator'
// trait).  We probably could do the latter because nothing we would usually
// store in a 'bdef_MemFnInstance' would require it (in all known uses the
// instance wrapper is a raw pointer, or some kind of smart pointer, to the
// 'ObjectType').  For the sake of correctness and generality, we do the
// former.
