@PURPOSE: [DEPRECATED] Provide containers with 2 templatized parameters.

@DEPRECATED: Clients should use STL containers as an alternative.

@DESCRIPTION: The 'bdec2' package provides a variety of container classes 
 more specialized than those provided by the STL.  In general 'bdec2'
 containers are associative containers of two distinct types.  The 'bdec2'
 containers include:
..
    1. A templated map, performing most typical map operations in constant
       time with worst-case bounds of linear time.
    2. A templated ordered map, which is a map whose keys are ordered.
    3. A templated multimap, in which keys may map to more than one value,
       and values need not be unique.
