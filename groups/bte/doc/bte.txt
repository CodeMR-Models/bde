@PURPOSE: Provide support, services, and frameworks for transport (IPC)

@MNEMONIC: Basic Transport Environment (bte)

@AUTHOR: Tom Marshall (tmarshal)

@LAST_MODIFIED: August 2, 2004

@DESCRIPTION: The 'bte' ("Basic Transport Environment") package group provides
 a variety of concrete transport (IPC) mechanisms and services that conform to
 a uniform set of pure abstract interfaces.  In addition, 'bte' supplies
 low-level support for sockets and event managers, and a higher-level
 multi-threaded transport framework that is similar in functionality to
 'ptdispatch'.  As of this release, there is no support in 'bte' for 'fstsend',
 but we expect to add this functionality in the next release.

/Hierarchical Synopsis
/---------------------
 'bte' depends upon the 'bce' and 'bde' package groups:
..
    Level 3:   bte

    Level 2:   bce

    Level 1:   bde
.. 

 'bte' currently has has six packages forming five levels of dependency.  Note
 that 'bte' contains the required source control package 'btescm' (as does
 every package group, appropriately named).  See {BP BDE_SCM <GO>} for a
 detailed specification for this package, and see the 'bde' package group
 documentation for a brief description of the 'bdescm' package services, which
 are identical in concept to 'btescm'.  'btescm' is not discussed any further
 in this document.  The table below shows the hierarchical ordering of the
 packages.
..
   Level 5: btemt

   Level 4: btesos

   Level 3: btesc    bteso

   Level 2: btes

   Level 1: btescm 
..

/Package Overview
/----------------
 The following provides an overview of the 'bte' packages.  The subsections are
 still very brief.  See the respective Package Level documents for more details
 and usage examples.

/btemt
/- - -
 'btemt' provides a multi-threaded framework that supports TCP/IPv4 transport.
 In functionality, 'btemt' is similar to 'ptdispatch' except that there is no
 support for 'fstsnd' at this time.
 
/btes
/- -
 'btes' provides "system level" services that are required by this transport
 package group in a form that is portable across all suported platforms.
 Currently, the package supplies objects and utilities to implement the Unix
 'iovec' ("scatter/gather") buffer structure in a platform-neutral form.

/btesc
/- - -
 'btesc' provides a suite of protocols (i.e., pure abstract interfaces)
 abstracting the general behavior of communications "channels".  All
 abstractions in this package consider stream-based (as opposed to
 message-based) transport.  The three general abstractions are called
 "channel", "channel allocator", and "allocator factory".  In our usage,
 "allocator" and "factory" are synonymous; we use different words to avoid
 repetition.  In simplest form, "channel" abstracts the concept of an endpoint
 of a communication mechanism, providing appropriate "read" and "write"
 methods, while a "channel allocator" dispenses channels as resources, and
 hence abstracts the concepts of creating and destroying channels.  Finally, a
 "(channel) allocator factory" is substantially a naming service that is
 capable of dispensing channel allocators that will in turn dispense channels
 that are appropriately connected of concrete event managers.  Each of the
 above interfaces is available in blocking and non-blocking form, and with and
 without support for timeouts.

/bteso
/- - -
 'bteso' provides relatively low-level support for sockets as well as a number
 of concrete event managers.

/btesos
/- - -
 'btesos' provides concrete impementations of 'btesc' channels using TCP/IPv4
 sockets.  Timed and untimed, and blocking and non-blocking versions of generic
 channels, acceptors, and connectors are provided.
