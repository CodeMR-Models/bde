@PURPOSE: Provide versioning information for 'bte' library components.

@MNEMONIC: Basic Transport Environment Source Control Management (btescm)

@AUTHOR: Tom Marshall (tmarshal)

@DESCRIPTION: The 'btescm' package is identical in design and purpose to the
 'bdescm' package, except that 'btescm' is incorporated into each 'bte'
 component to provide uniform versioning information for that package group.
 See the 'bdescm' package documentation for details.
