@PURPOSE: Provide versioning information for library components in 'bce'

@MNEMONIC: Basic Concurrency Environment Source Control Management (bcescm)

@AUTHOR David Laurance (dlauranc)
 
@DESCRIPTION: This package is for use only by the BDE library.  Components in
 the 'bce' package group include this component in order to generate versioning
 information.  Developers use this versioning information to track releases of
 individual components when diagnosing problems using the 'bce' library.

 This component is only used within the 'bce' package group.  Each BDE package
 group contains a similar component that provides the same functionality for
 components in that package group.  This minor redundancy means that no
 dependencies between package groups are introduced, and thus separate package
 groups can be deployed independently from one another.

 In normal usage, developers should not need to refer to this component.
