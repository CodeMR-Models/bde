@PURPOSE: Provide a single interface for messaging using the 'bdem' package.

@MNEMONIC: Basic Concurrency Environment Messaging (bcem)

@AUTHOR: Rohan Bhindwale (rbhindwa)

@SEE ALSO: bdem, baexml

@DESCRIPTION: The 'bcem' package provides a single interface for firm-wide
 "messaging" using the components in the 'bdem' package.  Messaging in BDE
 refers to the in-core marshaling of arbitrarily hierarchical, self-describing
 data.  In conjunction with 'bdex' (see the 'bdex' package documentation), BER
 (see the 'bdem' package documentation), and XML (see the 'baexml' package
 documentation) externalization mechanisms, 'bcem' messaging provides fast,
 efficient, and convenient conversion from the in-core representation to a
 stream suitable for out-of-process transport (e.g., IPC, writing to a
 database, etc.).

/Hierarchical Synopsis
/---------------------
 'bcem' currently has 2 components having 2 levels of physical dependency.
 The table below shows the hierarchical ordering of the components.  The
 package prefix and underscore ('bcem_') are omitted from the full component
 names for layout efficiency.

  Level 2: aggregateutil

  Level 1: aggregate

/Component Synopsis
/------------------
 The following is a brief synopsis of the components in 'bcem'.  For the sake
 of brevity, we sometimes blur the distinction between a component and the
 primary types that the component provides.  We remind the reader that, in
 general, the distinction between a component and a class is important.

/bcem_aggregate
/- - - - - - -
 The 'bcem_aggregate' component provides an interface to bind a 'bdem'
 aggregate ("data") object with a 'bdem' schema ("meta-data") object.  Once
 constructed, clients can use 'bcem_Aggregate' objects to perform by-name (as
 specified in the schema) access to the data.

/bcem_aggregateutil
/- - - - - - - - -
 The 'bcem_aggregateutil' component provides utility functions to convert to
 and from 'bcem_Aggregate' objects to various user-defined types that match
 the structure of the 'bcem_Aggregate' object.
