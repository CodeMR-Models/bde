White Papers
============

This page contains a collection of short papers delineating objective analysis
and software engineering best practices performed and endorsed here at
Bloomberg. This material reflects literally hundreds of man years of
experience of writing hierarchically reusable libraries relied-upon by
thousands of engineers in their day-to-day work. Implementing these practices,
along with understanding their rationale, will guide the reader toward
creating code that is profoundly more efficient, robust, and maintainable.
