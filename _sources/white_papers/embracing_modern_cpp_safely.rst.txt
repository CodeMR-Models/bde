Abstract
--------
 As more and more of Bloomberg's software is migrated to run exclusively on
 Linux, Bloomberg has the opportunity to adopt modern C++ language features.
 Such a journey, however, is not without risk: Years of experience using Modern
 C++ has shown that, along with many advantages, it brings new pitfalls.
 Although many of these 'gotchas' are addressed in publicly available books,
 coding standards, and best-practices guides, these resources vary
 substantially in their scope, accuracy, and applicability. Moreover, the
 recommendations they put forth are sometimes controversial, and often differ
 from one to the next.  By creating a new, intentionally concise paper that
 addresses only the common pitfalls of useful modern C++ language constructs
 without prescribing any solutions, we aim to equip developers -- in addition
 to groups choosing to create local design rules, coding standards, or best
 practices -- with information suitable for making sound engineering decisions
 appropriate for the development context at hand.  To realize this new paper,
 we first created a draft based on the input from internal senior C++
 developers, and then circulated it to several C++ Standards committee members
 during the Jacksonville meeting held in March, 2018. In response to feedback
 from these experts, we made adjustments in emphasis regarding certain language
 features and their pitfalls. With this feedback incorporated, we now believe
 that the current version of the paper fairly represents our collective
 knowledge regarding the issues that might arise when using modern C++
 standards in industrial development organizations.

 We have published this paper internally to obtain additional feedback from
 engineers throughout Bloomberg in the hope of raising this work to a level of
 quality suitable for public dissemination worldwide. Any and all corrections,
 comments and/or criticisms are both warmly welcome and appreciated.

 Finally, in passing, we mention a few of the luminaries who have reviewed and
 already endorsed the purpose and accuracy of this paper: Marshall Clow,
 Alexander Evdokimov, Pablo Halpern, ADAM Martin, Alisdair Meredith, Axel
 Naumann, Gor Nishanov, Jeffrey Olkin, Nina Ranns, David Sankel, Bjarne
 Stroustrup, Andrew Sutton, Alan Talbot, Tony Van Eerd, JC Van Winkel, Ville
 Voutilainen, Titus Winters, and Michael Wong.
