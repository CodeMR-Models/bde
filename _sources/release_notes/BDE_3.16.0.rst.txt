Recategorization of Defensive Checks
------------------------------------

Background
**********
  BDE is starting a campaign to recategorize many of the existing
  ``BSLS_ASSERT_SAFE`` defensive programming checks to ``BSLS_ASSERT``.  Since
  many client builds enable ``BSLS_ASSERT`` but disable ``BSLS_ASSERT_SAFE``
  the end result will be additional checks enabled in production code.

  The impetus for this change is that the guidelines for deciding on which
  assert macro to use have evolved, and now it is clear that only tests which
  will have very large performance impacts on a function should use
  ``BSLS_ASSERT_SAFE``.

  To facilitate this migration, we will be using ``BSLS_REVIEW`` to safely
  migrate the level of assertions within the BDE codebase.  The first stage of
  migration for each check will be to make it a ``BSLS_REVIEW``, which will
  begin to check the condition when enabled but will only log the failure
  instead of aborting.  ``BSLS_REVIEW`` was added in BDE Release 3.14.0, see
  the release notes for that version and the documentation of
  `bsls_review </bde-resources/doxygen/bde_api_prod/group__bsls__review.html>`_
  for a more complete description of this feature.

What Does This Mean To You?
***************************
  As checks migrate they will begin to log if they are being violated.  If you
  see these log messages containing the phrase ``BSLS_REVIEW failure``
  appearing on ``stderr`` (standard error) then a BDE function is being called
  out of its checked contract.  This indicates a bug in either the calling code
  or the check itself.  Please investigate the problem and escalate to the BDE
  team if there seems to be an issue in the newly enabled check.

  After a check has been deployed (and not been violated) for a significant
  enough amount of time, we will be turning it into a ``BSLS_ASSERT``.
  Notifications about this happening should be in future BDE Release notes.
